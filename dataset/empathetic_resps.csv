Can't walk anymore that much, seems its pulling my belly muscles and it's really hurts (dr said its attached to the front wall) a quess that's why the pain and I feel already so big (emojis). I'm trying to eat lots of fruits. Not being healthy as I wish cos 5 days a week I'm to one who is cooking and looking after the house (husband does 12h shifts 5-6days a week). I'm just wrecked and if I feel so I have a cookie or chocolate or 2-4... hopefully wheater improves and so my energy levels and being a bit more healthier then atm. And no I didn't do the snacks. I cook every day 3 meals for fam of 5 and atm I do not have that energy to do extra at any level. Sorry. Thank you for your messages and talk to you soon (participant name)","Hi (participant name),

Thank you for opening up about what you're going through. It sounds like you're juggling a lot right now. How are you holding up with everything that's been happening?

If you'd like, we can revisit your goals together to see if there's a way to adjust them to better fit your current situation. Just let me know if that would be helpful.

Take care, and I'm here whenever you need to chat."
1,"The next two weeks are extremely busy in work with the last two teaching weeks of term. It should hopefully be less hectic once it gets to corrections. Life is very busy and stressful at the moment, so I am only focusing on making sure I get the supplements every day and trying not to eat too much chocolate for the next two weeks. I've been trying to add some fruit, but I'm still eating loads of veggies, so I'm not overly stressing about that one. I know exercise helps with all this, but I don't have the time or headspace to fit it in at the moment, especially not something new. I will look at the stretches and set a new goal once I have survived this fortnight!","It sounds like you're navigating a really busy and stressful period, and it's completely understandable that you're focusing on the essentials to get through it. It's great that you're making sure to take your supplements and trying to keep a balanced diet with veggies and some fruit. This shows a lot of self-awareness and care for your well-being. I know finding time for exercise can be tough when you're already stretched thin, and it's perfectly okay to prioritize and set new goals once things calm down. How do you feel about your current approach to managing stress during this hectic time?"
2,"Hi (coach name), Thanks for your videos, only seeing the last 2 now. Yes all is fine with the goals. However you are right, logging them and engaging in app is not top priority at the moment. I am happy with the goals I've set, breakfast, water and walking is being achieved at my pace. I am motivated to do as much as I can regarding healthy choices but also listening to my body when I need rest and a cup of tea. Nausea and sickness has lessened in the last 2 weeks so that has enabled me to eat more consciously and get back to some healthy breakfasts (like yoghurt, fruit and seeds etc). Walking in the evening is still sporadic but I am enjoying it and have engaged in a 100k in 30 days for charity with work. Again I am doing this when I feel I can and at my own pace. I am happy with my diet and behaviour right now and cravings are not an issue actually. I find my blood sugar to be stable too. Unfortunately I cannot promise more engagement with App, I will log when I think of it. Hope thats okay (emojis) thanks again, (participant name)","Hi (participant name),

Thanks for the update! It sounds like you're doing a fantastic job of listening to your body and making healthy choices at your own pace. I'm glad to hear the nausea and sickness have eased up, allowing you to enjoy more nutritious breakfasts. Participating in the 100k in 30 days for charity is a great initiative, and it's wonderful that you're approaching it in a way that feels comfortable for you.

No worries about the app engagementâ€”your well-being is the priority, and it seems like you're finding a good balance. How are you finding the support from the app and the videos? Is there anything else you need from me right now?

Thanks again for keeping me updated, and I'm here whenever you need support or have any questions. ðŸ˜Š"
3,"Hi (coach name). I'm doing ok so far, did great step account on last month but just after I hit my 20week/5mnt mark. I feel extremely tired and struggling to get 10 thousand step per day and partly I feel worn out and a bit if pain cos womb is attached on the front of the belly wall and I have constant 'pulling/stretching' pain. Less bread of course is still my coal l close list... or now might I need to munch less cookies. Its raining way too much for my liking and not having no energy lately will I say effect my treats snacking and mood lifting with food. I'll keep my goals atm the same just not to push my self more for something I can't accomplish and not having then self let down moments (participant name)","Hi there! It sounds like you're having a challenging time, and I can see why you might be feeling exhausted and in pain. It's perfectly normal to feel tired, especially with the changes your body is experiencing. That constant pulling and stretching pain must be really uncomfortable. It's great that you're acknowledging your limits and not pushing yourself too hard. Would you like us to take a look at your goals together to see if there's anything we can adjust to make things a bit easier for you?"
4,"Hi (coach name), I did a recording but I am not too sure where it saved so I stick with writing a little paragraph. Last week was a great week for exercise. I reached my 7 hrs a week exercise by doing my hour walk Monday to Friday and I started my exercise bike Friday and do that for 20 mins in the morning. Last Thursday I became really fizzy whilst on my walk and sweating. A weird sensation that came over me for about 10 mins. Perhaps my stomach was empty or was just over tired. My diet has not been great, although I've been drinking my water, food intake and treats have been a weakness, especially over the bank holiday weekend being out for picnics and a birthday party. The tips on physical activity is good. I actually do a good bit of gardening and cleaning so I should incorporate that into my exercise. I literally do not stop at home from 6.30 am intill 7pm. Kids are quite demanding (emoji)","Hi there! It sounds like you had a productive week with your exercise routine, and it's fantastic that you hit your 7-hour goal. Adding the exercise bike is a great move. The sensation you felt during your walk might have been due to an empty stomach or just being tired, so it's important to pay attention to what your body needs.

Balancing a healthy diet can be tough, especially with events like picnics and birthday parties. It's great that you're keeping up with your water intake, though! Including gardening and cleaning as part of your exercise is a smart idea since they can be quite physically demanding.

If you'd like, we can review your goals together to see if there's anything we can tweak or improve. Let me know how I can support you!"
5,"Hello (coach name) good morning. My week was great, tnks God (emojis) the only problem was that I got so angry with my husband during the week. Is it normal to get so angry during pregnancy? I hope you had a good week too. Thank you very much for the link, I gonna try to make something (emoji) and to contact the clinic. I have to take a vaccine on Wednesday and I can ask to my GP if he got my results. For any reason I ate much better during last week. I'll start to write down my all of my food, as you said. I think is going to be much better to understand what's happening.","Good morning! I'm glad to hear that your week went well overall. It's completely normal to feel more emotional or easily upset during pregnancy because of hormonal changes, so you're definitely not alone in this. It's great that you're planning to talk to your GP about your results and that you're taking steps to track your food intake. Keeping a food journal can really help you understand your eating patterns and make any necessary adjustments. How do you feel about starting this food journal?"
6,"Hi (coach name), I was having a rough week last week. Busy with work and also I was unwell some days. I feel better now. And I will continue updating my daily goals. Thanks for the support. I don't us my mobile phone regularly. I am not familiar with apps and all. I have to depend on my husband for technical things. That's why I am not up to date. And moreover my smart phone is an old one. That's why I can't show the steps in the mobile. Thank you (participant name)","Hi (participant name),

I'm really glad to hear you're feeling better. It's completely understandable to have a tough week, especially when you're balancing work and not feeling your best. Many people find technology a bit tricky, so it's perfectly okay to lean on your husband for help. Your dedication to keeping up with your daily goals, despite these challenges, is truly admirable.

If you'd like, we can review your goals together to see if there's anything we can adjust to make things easier for you.

Thank you for sharing, and I'm here to support you in any way I can."
7,"Hi (coach name) Thank you! Yes baby boy born Wednesday, a lovely calm elective section and only 31 hours in hospital after. I am useless, sorry missed all of these messages and most from family and friends (emojis). Definitely did too much at once with a pretty non flexible deadline! Realised as well I never did a final weigh in before c section! Never managed to start up yoga or other exercise beyond daily life needs but as soon as I am fit and able I must start some activities again. Will book in for a video chat in January. Thank you for not giving up on me! Newborn life is just as I remember it but I seem to be more used to sleep deprivation so I will need to look at some of those mindfulness techniques you sent. Breastfeeding mega demanding and sore but I know will be best in the long run (just need to remember to put the vit d drops on before we start (emojis)). Whole house is very excited for Christmas, (name) is especially keen but I love it because it keeps me going. Hope you're well and looking forward to Christmas with the family (participant name) x","Hi there! Congratulations on the arrival of your baby boy! It sounds like everything went smoothly with the elective section, and it's impressive that you were able to leave the hospital so quickly. I completely understand how overwhelming it can be to keep up with messages during such a busy time, especially with a newborn. You're doing your best, and it's perfectly okay to take things one step at a time.

I know starting yoga or other exercises might have been tough with everything going on, but it's great that you're planning to get back into activities when you're ready. I'm here to support you whenever you decide to start again.

Breastfeeding can be quite demanding and sore, but your commitment to doing what's best for your baby is clear. Remembering the vitamin D drops is a great step, and I'm sure you'll find your rhythm soon.

It's wonderful to hear that the whole house is excited for Christmas, and it's great that it brings you joy and keeps you going. I hope you have a fantastic time with your family during the holidays.

Looking forward to our video chat in January. In the meantime, if there's anything specific you'd like to discuss or need support with, just let me know. Enjoy this special time with your newborn!"
8,"Hi (coach name), Iâ€™m doing ok thanks just really bad on keeping you updated on here. Iâ€™m really sorry. I was wondering going forwards if we could do quick 5-10 mins call update. Is this something you can do? Iâ€™m just very bad at assigning time to sit down and write as always get distracted and put it off to later. No worries if this is not possible. The PGP has actually calmed down which is great and have been able to go out for walks again and generally just move about a bit more. The midwife has referred me for some physio so waiting for an appointment to come through. Iâ€™m also told they might give me belt to wear which will help. I have noticed this week (probably because of the heat) that my fingers / hands & feet are quite swollen. My water intake has dropped so have put a reminder in my work calendar to alert me. Food wise, my portion size is still on the large size. Donâ€™t know how to manage this. Hope to speak to you soon Thanks (participant name)","Hi (participant name),

Thanks for reaching out and updating me. I completely understand that writing updates can be tough with everything you have going on. A quick 5-10 minute call sounds like a great idea, and I'm more than happy to make that work. Just let me know what times suit you best, and we can arrange it.

I'm really glad to hear that the PGP has eased up and you're able to enjoy walks and move around more. It's great that your midwife has referred you for physio, and hopefully, the belt will offer some extra relief. Swelling in your hands and feet can be uncomfortable, especially in the heat, so it's smart to have set a reminder to drink more water.

If you'd like, we can also discuss some strategies to help manage your portion sizes. Let me know if that would be helpful.

Looking forward to chatting with you soon.

Take care,

9,"Hi (coach name), Thanks for your advice about proteins, Iâ€™ve added it to my goals. Unfortunately, Iâ€™ve been extremely unwell the last 2 weeks which included me collapsing and having a lovely trip to hospital in an ambulance. My body is fighting a viral infection and shut down. I hit my head and have a lovely black eye. Due to this my goals and everything have taken a backseat. Iâ€™ve been advised to sit down as much as possible with my feet up. Iâ€™m struggling with controlling my body temp so am constantly hot which is making things worse! I went back to work Thursday and managed ok. The baby is causing me to have my first cravings - wholegrain cheerios! Iâ€™ve just booked in my c section in 5 weeks! Any advice on how to prepare would be great. Iâ€™ve been signposted to Bluebell to support with my mental health although feeling ok at the moment. I am starting maternity leave in 2 weeks so will have a lot more time for me (for a few weeks lol!) Sorry for the long message! (participant name)","Hi (participant name),

I'm really sorry to hear about what you've been going through. It sounds like it's been a challenging time, and it's completely understandable that your goals have taken a backseat. Right now, your health and well-being are the top priorities, so it's great that you're following the advice to rest and take care of yourself.

Cravings during pregnancy are quite common, and wholegrain Cheerios are a healthy choice! As you prepare for your c-section in 5 weeks, focusing on rest and self-care is key. It might be helpful to start thinking about any support you might need post-surgery, like arranging help with daily tasks or preparing meals in advance.

It's wonderful that you've been signposted to Bluebell for mental health support, even if you're feeling okay at the moment. Having that support in place can be really beneficial.

Starting maternity leave soon will hopefully give you some time to relax and prepare for the new arrival. You're doing an amazing job managing everything, and it's completely normal to feel a range of emotions during this time.

If there's anything specific you'd like advice on as you prepare for the c-section, feel free to let me know. You're a fantastic mom, and taking care of yourself is the best thing you can do for both you and your baby.

Take care, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything."
