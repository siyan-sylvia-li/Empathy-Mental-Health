0,"HI (coach name). Sorry for not answering sooner. Seems to time files (1.1) and I get nothing done (1.2) and every day seems to have less and less energy to do anything. Its been 3 days raining and I have had very little sleep because of my daughter bloods are very unsuitable at night time. Can't walk anymore that much, seems its pulling my belly muscles and it's really hurts (dr said its attached to the front wall) a quess that's why the pain and I feel already so big (emojis). I'm trying to eat lots of fruits. Not being healthy as I wish cos 5 days a week I'm to one who is cooking and looking after the house (husband does 12h shifts 5-6days a week). I'm just wrecked and if I feel so I have a cookie or chocolate or 2-4... hopefully wheater improves and so my energy levels and being a bit more healthier then atm. And no I didn't do the snacks. I cook every day 3 meals for fam of 5 and atm I do not have that energy to do extra at any level. Sorry. Thank you for your messages and talk to you soon (participant name)","Hi (participant name), thank you so much for your honest message. First of all, please don’t apologize—you’re juggling so much right now, and it’s completely understandable to feel overwhelmed and exhausted. Lack of sleep, the weather, and the extra demands at home can really take a toll on your energy and motivation.

It sounds like you’re doing your absolute best under very challenging circumstances, and I want to acknowledge how much you’re already managing for your family. It’s okay if things aren’t perfect right now—sometimes just getting through the day is enough.

If you’re feeling pain when walking, please continue to listen to your body and take it easy. Your health and your daughter’s are the top priorities. If you need to rest, that’s absolutely valid.

As for meals and snacks, it’s completely fine to keep things simple. If you’re able to add in some fruit or something easy, that’s great, but please don’t put extra pressure on yourself to do more than you can right now. Small steps are still progress.

If you ever want to talk or need support, I’m here for you. Take care of yourself as best you can, and remember that this tough period will pass. Sending you lots of strength and hoping you get some rest soon.

Talk soon,

1,"The next two weeks are extremely busy in work with the last two teaching weeks of term. It should hopefully be less hectic once it gets to corrections. Life is very busy and stressful at the moment, so I am only focusing on making sure I get the supplements every day and trying not to eat too much chocolate for the next two weeks. I've been trying to add some fruit, but I'm still eating loads of veggies, so I'm not overly stressing about that one. I know exercise helps with all this, but I don't have the time or headspace to fit it in at the moment, especially not something new. I will look at the stretches and set a new goal once I have survived this fortnight!","It sounds like you have a lot on your plate right now, and it’s completely understandable to focus on just the essentials when things get hectic. You’re doing a great job by keeping up with your supplements and veggies, and being mindful about the chocolate—sometimes just maintaining the basics is a big win during busy times! 

Don’t worry about not fitting in new exercise routines; sometimes just getting through the day is enough. When things settle down after these two weeks, you can reassess and set new goals at your own pace. Be kind to yourself and remember that this busy period won’t last forever. You’ve got this!"
2,"Hi (coach name), Thanks for your videos, only seeing the last 2 now. Yes all is fine with the goals. However you are right, logging them and engaging in app is not top priority at the moment. I am happy with the goals I've set, breakfast, water and walking is being achieved at my pace. I am motivated to do as much as I can regarding healthy choices but also listening to my body when I need rest and a cup of tea. Nausea and sickness has lessened in the last 2 weeks so that has enabled me to eat more consciously and get back to some healthy breakfasts (like yoghurt, fruit and seeds etc). Walking in the evening is still sporadic but I am enjoying it and have engaged in a 100k in 30 days for charity with work. Again I am doing this when I feel I can and at my own pace. I am happy with my diet and behaviour right now and cravings are not an issue actually. I find my blood sugar to be stable too. Unfortunately I cannot promise more engagement with App, I will log when I think of it. Hope thats okay (emojis) thanks again, (participant name)","Hi (participant name), thank you so much for your thoughtful update! I’m really glad to hear that you’re feeling better and that the nausea has eased up—that makes such a difference. It’s fantastic that you’re tuning in to your body’s needs and finding a balance between healthy choices and rest. Your approach to walking and participating in the 100k challenge at your own pace is exactly the right mindset—consistency and enjoyment matter more than perfection.

No worries at all about the app engagement; your wellbeing comes first, and it’s great to hear you’re happy with your progress and routines. Logging is just a tool to support you, not something to add pressure. If you ever want to check in or have questions, I’m here for you, but please continue to do what feels right for you.

Keep up the great work, and enjoy those cups of tea! 😊  
Best,

3,"Hi (coach name). I'm doing ok so far, did great step account on last month but just after I hit my 20week/5mnt mark. I feel extremely tired and struggling to get 10 thousand step per day and partly I feel worn out and a bit if pain cos womb is attached on the front of the belly wall and I have constant 'pulling/stretching' pain. Less bread of course is still my coal l close list... or now might I need to munch less cookies. Its raining way too much for my liking and not having no energy lately will I say effect my treats snacking and mood lifting with food. I'll keep my goals atm the same just not to push my self more for something I can't accomplish and not having then self let down moments (participant name)","Hi (participant name), thank you so much for sharing how you’re feeling and for being so honest about where you’re at right now. First of all, congratulations on hitting your 20-week/5-month mark and for doing so well with your step goal last month—that’s a huge achievement!

It’s completely understandable to feel more tired and experience some discomfort as your pregnancy progresses, especially with the womb attached to the front of the belly wall. That pulling and stretching pain is common, but it can definitely make movement and daily activities more challenging. Please remember to listen to your body and rest when you need to—your health and your baby’s health come first.

It’s also great that you’re aware of your eating habits and how your mood and the weather can affect your choices. Rainy days and low energy can make it so tempting to reach for comfort foods, and that’s okay sometimes. Try to be gentle with yourself and focus on small, manageable changes rather than perfection. Maybe you could swap out some cookies for a fruit or yogurt snack, or just be mindful of portion sizes, but don’t feel guilty if you need a treat now and then.

Keeping your goals the same for now is a wise decision. It’s important to avoid putting extra pressure on yourself, especially when your body is working so hard. Progress isn’t always linear, and taking care of your mental and emotional well-being is just as important as physical goals.

If you ever want to talk through some gentle movement options or need ideas for mood-boosting activities that don’t involve food, I’m here for you. You’re doing an amazing job, and it’s okay to have ups and downs. Please keep me posted on how you’re feeling, and let me know if there’s anything specific you’d like support with.

Take care and be kind to yourself,

4,"Hi (coach name), I did a recording but I am not too sure where it saved so I stick with writing a little paragraph. Last week was a great week for exercise. I reached my 7 hrs a week exercise by doing my hour walk Monday to Friday and I started my exercise bike Friday and do that for 20 mins in the morning. Last Thursday I became really fizzy whilst on my walk and sweating. A weird sensation that came over me for about 10 mins. Perhaps my stomach was empty or was just over tired. My diet has not been great, although I've been drinking my water, food intake and treats have been a weakness, especially over the bank holiday weekend being out for picnics and a birthday party. The tips on physical activity is good. I actually do a good bit of gardening and cleaning so I should incorporate that into my exercise. I literally do not stop at home from 6.30 am intill 7pm. Kids are quite demanding (emoji)","Hi! Thank you so much for your update and for sharing how your week went. It sounds like you’ve done an amazing job staying active, especially with your walks and starting the exercise bike—well done on reaching your 7 hours! That’s a fantastic achievement, especially with such a busy schedule.

About the fizzy sensation and sweating during your walk, you’re right that it could be related to not having eaten enough beforehand or maybe feeling a bit overtired. It’s always a good idea to have a small snack before longer walks, especially if you haven’t eaten in a while, and to listen to your body if you need to slow down or take a break.

Don’t be too hard on yourself about your diet—special occasions and busy weekends happen! The important thing is that you’re aware and ready to get back on track. Drinking water and being mindful is already a great step.

It’s also fantastic that you’re recognizing all the activity you do at home—gardening, cleaning, and running after the kids absolutely count as physical activity! You’re moving a lot more than you might realize, and it all adds up.

Keep up the great work, and remember to take care of yourself too. If you ever want to try recording again, let me know and I can help you find where it saves. Otherwise, your written updates are perfect!

You’re doing brilliantly—keep going! 😊"
5,"Hello (coach name) good morning. My week was great, tnks God (emojis) the only problem was that I got so angry with my husband during the week. Is it normal to get so angry during pregnancy? I hope you had a good week too. Thank you very much for the link, I gonna try to make something (emoji) and to contact the clinic. I have to take a vaccine on Wednesday and I can ask to my GP if he got my results. For any reason I ate much better during last week. I'll start to write down my all of my food, as you said. I think is going to be much better to understand what's happening.","Hello! Thank you so much for your message and for sharing how your week went. First of all, it’s completely normal to experience stronger emotions, including anger, during pregnancy. Hormonal changes, physical discomfort, and the stress of preparing for a new baby can all make emotions feel more intense. You’re definitely not alone in this!

It’s great to hear that you’re planning to track your food—writing things down can really help you notice patterns and make positive changes. I’m glad you’re reaching out to your GP about your results and taking care of your health with the vaccine.

6,"Hi (coach name), I was having a rough week last week. Busy with work and also I was unwell some days. I feel better now. And I will continue updating my daily goals. Thanks for the support. I don't us my mobile phone regularly. I am not familiar with apps and all. I have to depend on my husband for technical things. That's why I am not up to date. And moreover my smart phone is an old one. That's why I can't show the steps in the mobile. Thank you (participant name)","Hi (participant name), thank you so much for your honest update. I’m really glad to hear you’re feeling better now! It’s completely understandable that a busy week and feeling unwell can make it hard to keep up with everything.

7,"Hi (coach name) Thank you! Yes baby boy born Wednesday, a lovely calm elective section and only 31 hours in hospital after. I am useless, sorry missed all of these messages and most from family and friends (emojis). Definitely did too much at once with a pretty non flexible deadline! Realised as well I never did a final weigh in before c section! Never managed to start up yoga or other exercise beyond daily life needs but as soon as I am fit and able I must start some activities again. Will book in for a video chat in January. Thank you for not giving up on me! Newborn life is just as I remember it but I seem to be more used to sleep deprivation so I will need to look at some of those mindfulness techniques you sent. Breastfeeding mega demanding and sore but I know will be best in the long run (just need to remember to put the vit d drops on before we start (emojis)). Whole house is very excited for Christmas, (name) is especially keen but I love it because it keeps me going. Hope you're well and looking forward to Christmas with the family (participant name) x","Hi (participant name), 

Congratulations again on your beautiful baby boy! It’s wonderful to hear that everything went smoothly with the section and that you’re all home and settling in. Please don’t worry for a second about missing messages—this is such a huge transition, and you’re doing exactly what you need to do right now. 

It sounds like you’re already doing an amazing job juggling everything, even if it doesn’t always feel that way. The final weigh-in and yoga can absolutely wait; your focus on healing and caring for your little one is what matters most. When you’re ready, we’ll ease back into things together—no rush at all.

I’m so glad the mindfulness techniques might be helpful. Even a few deep breaths or a quiet moment can make a difference, especially during those long nights. Breastfeeding can be tough at first, but you’re right—it does get easier, and you’re doing brilliantly. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need any support or just want to chat.

It sounds like Christmas will be extra special this year with your new arrival and (name)’s excitement! I hope you get to soak up all the magic and enjoy some well-deserved rest when you can.

Take care of yourself, and I’ll look forward to catching up in January. I’m always here if you need anything in the meantime.

Wishing you and your family a wonderful Christmas,

8,"Hi (coach name), I’m doing ok thanks just really bad on keeping you updated on here. I’m really sorry. I was wondering going forwards if we could do quick 5-10 mins call update. Is this something you can do? I’m just very bad at assigning time to sit down and write as always get distracted and put it off to later. No worries if this is not possible. The PGP has actually calmed down which is great and have been able to go out for walks again and generally just move about a bit more. The midwife has referred me for some physio so waiting for an appointment to come through. I’m also told they might give me belt to wear which will help. I have noticed this week (probably because of the heat) that my fingers / hands & feet are quite swollen. My water intake has dropped so have put a reminder in my work calendar to alert me. Food wise, my portion size is still on the large size. Don’t know how to manage this. Hope to speak to you soon Thanks (participant name)","Hi (participant name), thank you so much for your update and for being honest about what works best for you! No need to apologize at all—finding a way to check in that fits your routine is really important, and I’m happy to accommodate a quick 5-10 minute call for updates. Let’s find a time that works for both of us and get that set up going forward.

I’m really glad to hear your PGP has calmed down and that you’re able to get out for walks again—that’s fantastic progress! Fingers crossed the physio appointment comes through soon, and the belt can definitely be helpful for extra support.

Swelling in your hands and feet can be quite common, especially in the heat, but it’s great that you’re being proactive with your water intake. Setting reminders is a smart move. If the swelling gets worse or you notice any other symptoms (like headaches or vision changes), do let your midwife know just to be safe.

Regarding portion sizes, this is something we can definitely talk through on our call. In the meantime, a couple of quick tips: try using a smaller plate or bowl, and take a pause halfway through your meal to check in with your hunger levels. Sometimes just slowing down a little can help you notice when you’re comfortably full.

Let me know your availability for a call, and we’ll get something in the diary. Looking forward to catching up soon!

Best,

9,"Hi (coach name), Thanks for your advice about proteins, I’ve added it to my goals. Unfortunately, I’ve been extremely unwell the last 2 weeks which included me collapsing and having a lovely trip to hospital in an ambulance. My body is fighting a viral infection and shut down. I hit my head and have a lovely black eye. Due to this my goals and everything have taken a backseat. I’ve been advised to sit down as much as possible with my feet up. I’m struggling with controlling my body temp so am constantly hot which is making things worse! I went back to work Thursday and managed ok. The baby is causing me to have my first cravings - wholegrain cheerios! I’ve just booked in my c section in 5 weeks! Any advice on how to prepare would be great. I’ve been signposted to Bluebell to support with my mental health although feeling ok at the moment. I am starting maternity leave in 2 weeks so will have a lot more time for me (for a few weeks lol!) Sorry for the long message! (participant name)","Hi (participant name), 

Thank you so much for your update, and please don’t apologize for the long message—it’s really helpful to hear how you’re doing. I’m so sorry to hear about your recent illness and hospital trip; that sounds incredibly tough, and I hope you’re starting to feel a little better each day. It’s completely understandable that your goals have taken a backseat—your health and recovery are the absolute priority right now.

It’s great to hear you managed to get back to work, even if just for a bit, and that you’re listening to your body’s needs. Sitting with your feet up and taking things slowly is exactly what you should be doing. Cravings are totally normal, and wholegrain Cheerios are a pretty good choice—easy on the stomach and a bit of fiber, too!

With your c-section coming up in 5 weeks, it’s a good time to start thinking about preparing both physically and mentally. Here are a few tips:
- **Rest as much as possible**—your body is already working hard, and recovery from illness plus pregnancy is a lot.
- **Stay hydrated** and eat small, frequent meals if your appetite is off.
- **Prepare your home** for your return after the c-section: set up a comfortable recovery space, stock up on easy meals/snacks, and make sure you have everything you’ll need within reach.
- **Ask for help**—don’t hesitate to lean on friends, family, or your support network, especially in those first few weeks.
- **Gentle movement** (as you feel able and your doctor approves) like short walks around the house can help with circulation and mood.
- **Mental health**: It’s great you’ve been signposted to Bluebell, and even if you’re feeling okay now, it’s good to have that support in place just in case.

Starting maternity leave soon will hopefully give you a bit more breathing space to rest and focus on yourself before baby arrives. If you need any more advice or just want to chat, I’m here for you. Please keep prioritizing your health and take things one day at a time.

Wishing you a smooth recovery and a restful few weeks ahead!

Take care,

10,"I had a rough day at work, and then my significant other texted me out of the blue, saying they need some space. I don't know what to do or how to feel about it.","I'm really sorry you're going through such a tough time right now. Having a hard day at work is draining enough, and then getting a message like that from someone you care about can feel overwhelming and confusing. It's completely normal to feel upset, anxious, or even a bit lost in this situation.

If you can, try to give yourself a little time to process everything. Sometimes, when someone asks for space, it doesn't necessarily mean something is wrong with you or the relationship—it might just mean they need time to sort out their own feelings or stress. It can be hard not to jump to conclusions, but try to be gentle with yourself and avoid overthinking if you can.

In the meantime, do something small that feels comforting or grounding for you, whether that's taking a walk, listening to music, or talking to a friend. When you're ready, you might want to check in with your significant other to let them know you care and are there for them, but also respect their need for space.

Remember, it's okay to feel uncertain and to take care of yourself right now. If you want to talk more about it or just need to vent, I'm here for you."
11,My friend and I have been arguing a lot lately. We just can't seem to understand each other and it's causing a strain on our friendship.,"I'm really sorry you're going through this. It can be tough when communication breaks down with someone you care about. Sometimes, arguments happen because both people are feeling misunderstood or unheard. If you feel comfortable, maybe try having an honest conversation with your friend about how you're both feeling—not just about the arguments, but about what might be going on beneath the surface. Sometimes taking a break to cool off and then coming back to talk things through calmly can help, too.

It might also help to focus on listening to each other without interrupting or trying to ""win"" the argument. Letting your friend know you value the friendship and want to work things out can go a long way. If you want, I can suggest some ways to start that conversation or help you think through what you want to say. You're not alone in this—friendships can go through rough patches, but with effort, they can often come out stronger."
12,"Hi. I've been feeling really down lately. I lost my job a few months ago, and despite all my efforts, I haven't been able to find a new one. I'm starting to feel hopeless.","I'm really sorry you're feeling this way. Losing a job and struggling to find a new one can be incredibly tough, and it's completely understandable to feel down and discouraged. Please know that you're not alone—many people go through similar experiences, and it doesn't mean things won't get better.

If you feel comfortable, it might help to talk to someone you trust about how you're feeling, whether that's a friend, family member, or even a counselor. Sometimes just sharing your thoughts can lighten the load a bit.

In the meantime, try to be gentle with yourself. Looking for work is hard, especially when it feels like nothing is working out. Maybe you could take a small break, even just for a day, to do something you enjoy or that helps you relax. Sometimes a little distance can help you come back with fresh energy.

If you want, I can help brainstorm job search strategies, review your resume, or just listen if you need to vent. Whatever you need, I'm here for you."
13,"Honestly, I've been feeling so alone lately. It's been really difficult for me and it's starting to impact my friendship with my best friend.","I'm really sorry you're feeling this way. Loneliness can be so heavy, especially when it starts to affect your closest relationships. It’s understandable that you might be struggling to connect right now—sometimes, when we’re feeling low, it’s hard to reach out or be present, even with people we care about most.

If you feel comfortable, maybe you could share a bit of how you’re feeling with your best friend. Sometimes just letting someone know what’s going on can help ease the pressure and open up a supportive conversation. You’re not alone in feeling this way, even if it seems like it right now. If you want to talk more about what’s been going on, I’m here to listen."
14,"I've been feeling a bit discouraged lately. I've been trying to lose weight, but it's been really hard to stay motivated and see any progress.","I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling discouraged. Trying to lose weight can be tough, and it's completely normal to have ups and downs along the way. Progress can sometimes be slow or hard to notice, especially if you're focusing only on the scale. But every healthy choice you make—whether it's a walk, a nutritious meal, or just being kind to yourself—counts as progress, even if it doesn't show up right away.

If you're comfortable sharing, what kinds of things have you been trying so far? Sometimes small changes or a new approach can make things feel more manageable. And remember, it's okay to have setbacks; what matters most is that you keep going. You're not alone in this, and it's okay to ask for support when you need it. Be gentle with yourself—you’re doing something really important for your health and well-being."
15,I'm feeling really frustrated. My colleague keeps taking credit for my work and it's causing tension in the workplace.,"I'm really sorry you're dealing with that—it sounds incredibly frustrating and unfair. Having someone else take credit for your efforts can make work feel discouraging and even impact your confidence and motivation.

If you feel comfortable, you might consider having a calm, private conversation with your colleague to express how you’re feeling. Sometimes people aren’t aware of the impact of their actions, and a direct conversation can help clear things up. If that doesn’t feel safe or doesn’t help, it might be worth documenting specific instances and bringing them up with your manager or HR, focusing on the facts and how it affects your work and the team.

Remember, you deserve recognition for your contributions. If you’d like, I can help you brainstorm ways to address this or draft what you might say. Let me know how I can support you!"
16,"Honestly, I'm feeling really down. I just got laid off from my job in the tech industry and I'm feeling overwhelmed and unmotivated.","I'm really sorry you're going through this. Getting laid off is tough, especially in such a competitive industry, and it's completely normal to feel overwhelmed and unmotivated right now. Please remember that your job doesn't define your worth, even though it can feel that way sometimes.

If you feel up to it, maybe take a little time to process everything before jumping into job searching. Sometimes just acknowledging how hard this is can help. When you're ready, you might want to reach out to friends or former colleagues—people are often more willing to help than we expect. And if you need to talk or vent more, I'm here to listen.

You’re not alone in this, even if it feels that way. Things can and do get better, even if it takes a little time. If you want, I can help brainstorm next steps or just chat about anything else to take your mind off things."
17,"I've been feeling really overwhelmed lately. I recently started a new job, and I'm having a hard time keeping up with the workload and meeting the expectations.","I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling overwhelmed. Starting a new job can be a big adjustment, and it's completely normal to feel this way, especially when you're still learning the ropes and figuring out expectations.

Here are a few things that might help:

1. **Give Yourself Grace:** Remember, it takes time to get comfortable in a new role. Most people need weeks or even months to fully settle in.
2. **Prioritize Tasks:** Try making a list of your tasks and focus on the most important or urgent ones first. Breaking things down into smaller steps can make them feel more manageable.
3. **Ask for Help:** Don’t hesitate to reach out to your manager or coworkers if you’re unsure about something or need clarification. Most people understand what it’s like to be new and are willing to help.
4. **Set Boundaries:** If possible, try to set clear boundaries between work and personal time so you can recharge.
5. **Take Care of Yourself:** Make sure you’re getting enough rest, eating well, and taking breaks when you can.

You’re not alone in feeling this way, and it will get easier with time. If you want to talk more about what’s been challenging, I’m here to listen."
18,"It's been a few weeks since the breakup, but I still can't stop thinking about our memories and everything we shared. I feel so disconnected and alone without them.","I'm really sorry you're feeling this way. Breakups can be incredibly tough, especially when the memories are still so fresh. It's completely normal to feel disconnected and alone after losing someone who was such a big part of your life. Be gentle with yourself—healing takes time, and it's okay to miss what you had.

If you can, try to reach out to friends or family, even if it's just to talk or spend some quiet time together. Sometimes sharing how you feel, or just having someone listen, can help ease the loneliness a bit. You might also find comfort in doing small things for yourself, like going for a walk, journaling, or picking up a hobby you enjoy.

Remember, you're not alone in this, and these feelings will get easier to manage with time. If you ever feel overwhelmed, don't hesitate to talk to someone you trust or consider reaching out to a counselor. You're stronger than you think, and you will get through this."
19,"I've been having issues with my roommate. We can't seem to agree on how to divide the household chores, and it's causing a lot of frustration and tension between us.","I'm sorry you're dealing with that—it can be really tough when living situations get tense. Chores are a common source of conflict between roommates, but there are some ways you can try to work through it together:

1. **Have an Honest Conversation:** Set aside some time to talk when you’re both calm. Share how you’re feeling without blaming or accusing. Use “I” statements, like “I feel frustrated when the dishes pile up,” rather than “You never do the dishes.”

2. **List Out the Chores:** Make a list of all the regular chores that need to be done. Sometimes just seeing everything written out helps both people realize what needs to be managed.

3. **Divide Based on Preferences:** If possible, split chores based on what each of you dislikes least. Maybe one of you doesn’t mind vacuuming but hates taking out the trash, and vice versa.

4. **Create a Chore Chart or Schedule:** Having a visual reminder can help keep both of you accountable and make things feel more fair.

5. **Check In Regularly:** Set a time every couple of weeks to check in about how things are going. That way, small issues don’t build up into bigger frustrations.

6. **Be Flexible:** Sometimes life gets busy, and one person might need to pick up a little slack. If you both try to be understanding, it can help keep things balanced in the long run.

If you’ve tried talking and things still aren’t improving, it might help to bring in a neutral third party (like another friend or a resident advisor, if you’re in student housing) to mediate.

Would you like help coming up with a sample chore chart or conversation starter?"
20,I'm feeling really down lately. My best friend's mom passed away and she's having a tough time.,"I'm really sorry to hear that you're both going through such a hard time. Losing someone is never easy, and it can be especially tough to see a close friend hurting. It's understandable that you're feeling down too—caring for someone you love while processing your own emotions can be overwhelming.

If you feel comfortable, just being there for your friend, listening, and letting her know you care can mean a lot. And remember to take care of yourself as well. It's okay to feel sad and to reach out for support if you need it, whether that's talking to someone you trust or just taking some time for yourself.

If you want to talk more about how you're feeling or need ideas on how to support your friend, I'm here for you."
21,"I'm okay, thank you. I actually wanted to talk to you about something. My best friend is going through a tough time after losing her mom. It's been really hard for her to cope with the grief.","I'm really sorry to hear about your friend's loss. Losing a parent is incredibly difficult, and it's understandable that she's struggling right now. Just being there for her, like you are, can make a big difference. Sometimes, people just need someone to listen or sit with them, even if they don't want to talk much.

If you're not sure what to say, that's okay—sometimes just acknowledging her pain and letting her know you care is enough. You could offer to help with small things, like running errands or just spending time together doing something comforting. If she seems open to it, you might gently suggest talking to a counselor or joining a support group, but only if and when she's ready.

How are you holding up? Supporting someone through grief can be tough on you, too. If you want to talk more about it or need ideas on how to help her, I'm here for you."
22,"It's about my co-worker. Every time we have a team meeting, they always interrupt me and don't let me share my thoughts. It's really frustrating.","That sounds really frustrating, and it’s understandable that you’d feel upset about being interrupted, especially when you want to contribute to the team. Sometimes people don’t even realize they’re doing it, but it can still have a big impact.

If you feel comfortable, you might try talking to your co-worker privately and letting them know how you feel. You could say something like, “I’ve noticed that I often get interrupted during meetings, and I’d appreciate having the chance to finish my thoughts.” Sometimes just bringing it up can make a difference.

If that feels too direct, you could also try talking to your manager or the meeting facilitator. They can help set some ground rules for meetings, like making sure everyone gets a chance to speak without interruptions.

You deserve to have your voice heard! If you want, I can help you brainstorm more ways to handle this situation."
23,"My sibling just lost their pet. They've had that pet for so many years and they're heartbroken. I want to comfort them, but I'm not sure how to help.","I'm really sorry your sibling is going through this. Losing a pet is incredibly hard—they’re family, and the grief is real. Just being there for your sibling, listening, and letting them talk about their pet can mean a lot. You might encourage them to share stories or look at photos together if they want. Sometimes, small gestures like writing a note, making a little memorial, or just sitting with them in silence can be comforting. Let them know it’s okay to feel sad and that you’re there for them, however they need. If you’re not sure what to say, even a simple “I’m so sorry, I know how much you loved them” can help."
24,"I'm okay, but I've been feeling quite lonely lately.","I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. Loneliness can be tough, and it's something a lot of people experience at different times. If you’d like to talk more about what’s been going on, I’m here to listen. Sometimes just sharing what’s on your mind can help a bit. If you’re comfortable, maybe we can explore some ways to help you feel a little more connected or supported. Remember, you’re not alone in this."
25,"Exactly, it's like we're speaking different languages sometimes. I just want my partner to be able to understand me and provide the emotional support I need.","That makes a lot of sense, and it’s completely valid to want to feel understood and supported by your partner. Communication can be really tough, especially when it feels like you’re not on the same wavelength emotionally. Sometimes, it helps to talk openly about what kind of support you need—whether it’s just someone to listen, offer advice, or simply be there with you. Have you had a chance to share these feelings with your partner? Sometimes even just starting that conversation can make a big difference."
26,"I've been feeling really upset and ignored by my best friend lately. We used to be so close, but now it feels like they don't care about our friendship anymore.","I'm really sorry you're feeling this way. It hurts a lot when someone you care about seems distant or uninterested, especially when you've been so close. Sometimes friendships go through rough patches, and it doesn't always mean the other person doesn't care—it could be that they're dealing with their own stuff, or maybe they don't realize how their actions are affecting you.

If you feel comfortable, it might help to talk to your friend about how you're feeling. You could start by letting them know you miss how things used to be and ask if everything is okay. Try to use ""I"" statements, like ""I've been feeling a bit left out lately,"" so it doesn't sound like you're blaming them.

No matter what happens, your feelings are valid. If you want to talk more about it or need help figuring out what to say, I'm here for you."
27,I've been so stressed lately because I have a job interview coming up. I keep doubting myself and worrying that I won't do well.,"It’s completely normal to feel stressed and have doubts before a job interview—almost everyone goes through it! The fact that you care so much already shows your dedication. Try to remind yourself of your strengths and the experiences that got you this far. Sometimes, practicing answers out loud or even doing a mock interview with a friend can help boost your confidence.

Remember, interviews are as much about you seeing if the job is a good fit for you as they are about the employer getting to know you. Take a few deep breaths, and try to focus on sharing your story honestly. You’ve got this! If you want, I can help you brainstorm answers to common interview questions or give you some tips to calm your nerves. Just let me know what you need!"
28,"To be honest, work has been really tough lately. I'm feeling overwhelmed and starting to experience burnout.","I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. Burnout is tough, and it's important to acknowledge how you're feeling—you're not alone in this. If you can, try to take small breaks during your day, even if it's just a few minutes to step away and breathe. Sometimes talking to someone you trust, whether it's a friend, family member, or coworker, can help lighten the load a bit.

If you feel comfortable, it might also help to let your manager or HR know how you're feeling—they may be able to offer support or adjust your workload. Remember, your well-being matters, and it's okay to ask for help. If you want to talk more about what's been overwhelming you, I'm here to listen."
29,"Lately, my partner and I have been constantly arguing and having misunderstandings, and it's really taking a toll on our relationship.","I'm really sorry to hear that you and your partner are going through a tough time. Constant arguments and misunderstandings can feel exhausting and discouraging. It’s actually quite common for couples to go through rough patches, especially when communication breaks down or stress levels are high.

Here are a few things that might help:

1. **Pause and Reflect:** Sometimes, taking a step back to cool off before continuing a heated conversation can prevent things from escalating.
2. **Active Listening:** Try to really listen to each other’s perspectives without interrupting or planning your response. Sometimes, just feeling heard can make a big difference.
3. **Express, Don’t Accuse:** Use “I” statements to express how you feel, rather than “you” statements that can sound blaming. For example, “I feel hurt when…” instead of “You always…”
4. **Find Common Ground:** Focus on what you both want for your relationship, rather than who’s right or wrong.
5. **Consider Outside Support:** If things feel overwhelming, couples counseling can provide a safe space to work through issues with a neutral third party.

Remember, it’s okay to ask for help and to take care of yourselves individually, too. If you’d like, I can suggest some resources or communication exercises that might help. You’re not alone in this, and things can get better with time and effort."
30,"I have an important job interview coming up, and I can't shake off this anxiety. I don't know how to handle it.","It’s completely normal to feel anxious before a big interview—most people do! The good news is, there are some practical steps you can take to manage that anxiety and even use it to your advantage:

1. **Preparation is key:** The more prepared you are, the more confident you’ll feel. Research the company, review the job description, and practice common interview questions out loud. If you can, do a mock interview with a friend or in front of a mirror.

2. **Plan ahead:** Lay out your outfit, print extra copies of your resume, and plan your route if it’s in person. This reduces last-minute stress.

3. **Practice calming techniques:** Try deep breathing, mindfulness, or even a short walk before the interview. These can help calm your nerves and clear your mind.

4. **Reframe your thoughts:** Instead of thinking of the interview as a test, try to see it as a conversation where both sides are figuring out if it’s a good fit.

5. **Visualize success:** Picture yourself answering questions confidently and connecting with your interviewer. Visualization can help boost your self-assurance.

6. **Accept some nerves:** A little anxiety is normal and can actually help you stay alert and focused. Remind yourself that it’s okay to feel this way.

If you want, I can help you practice some interview questions or give you more tips tailored to your situation. You’ve got this!"
31,"About a year ago, I survived a sexual assault and since then, I find it really hard to open up and trust people. I'm scared to get close to anyone now.","I'm so sorry you're feeling this way, and I want you to know that what you're experiencing is a completely valid response to trauma. Surviving a sexual assault can deeply impact your sense of safety and trust, and it's understandable that opening up to others feels difficult right now.

You’re not alone in feeling this way, and healing is possible—even if it takes time. It might help to talk to a therapist or counselor who specializes in trauma or sexual assault; they can offer support and tools to help you process what happened and rebuild trust at your own pace. If reaching out to a professional feels overwhelming, sometimes connecting with a trusted friend or joining a support group (in person or online) can also be a gentle first step.

Most importantly, be kind to yourself. It’s okay to set boundaries and take things slowly. Your feelings are valid, and you deserve support and understanding as you heal. If you ever want resources or just someone to listen, I’m here for you."
32,It's my colleague at work. They keep stealing my ideas and taking credit for my work. It's really starting to get on my nerves.,"That sounds incredibly frustrating, and it’s understandable that you’re upset. Having your ideas taken and not getting the credit you deserve can really impact your motivation and work satisfaction.

Here are a few steps you might consider:

1. **Document Your Work:** Start keeping a record of your ideas, contributions, and when you share them (emails, meeting notes, etc.). This can help establish a clear timeline of your input.

2. **Speak Up in Meetings:** When you have an idea, try to share it in group settings or via email where your contribution is visible to others. This makes it harder for someone else to claim it as their own.

3. **Address It Directly (If You Feel Comfortable):** Sometimes, people aren’t aware of how their actions affect others. You could have a calm, private conversation with your colleague and let them know how you feel.

4. **Talk to Your Manager:** If the behavior continues and it’s affecting your work, consider discussing it with your manager or HR. Focus on the impact on your work and the team, rather than making it personal.

5. **Stay Professional:** As hard as it is, try to remain professional in your interactions. This will help you maintain your credibility and reputation.

You deserve recognition for your hard work. If you want to talk through how to approach your colleague or manager, I’m here to help!"
33,"Honestly, I've been feeling really overwhelmed and stressed out. My boss keeps piling up tasks on me, and I can't seem to catch a break. I'm struggling to meet all the deadlines.","I'm really sorry you're feeling this way. It sounds like you're under a lot of pressure, and that's tough to handle. You're not alone—many people go through periods like this, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed.

If you can, it might help to talk to your boss about your workload. Sometimes managers aren't aware of how much is on your plate until you let them know. You could try prioritizing your tasks or asking which ones are most urgent, so you can focus on what's most important first.

Also, remember to take short breaks when you can, even if it's just a few minutes to breathe or step away from your desk. Taking care of yourself is important, too.

If you want to talk more about what's going on or need help figuring out how to approach your boss, I'm here to listen and help however I can."
34,"Yeah, it's been tough. I left all my friends behind and now I don't know how to meet new people.","I'm really sorry you're feeling this way. Moving on from friends and starting over somewhere new can be really hard. It takes time to build new connections, so try to be gentle with yourself. If you feel up to it, maybe you could look for local groups or activities that match your interests—sometimes things like classes, clubs, or volunteering can be a good way to meet people. Even just chatting with classmates or coworkers can be a start. You're definitely not alone in feeling this way, and things can get better with time. If you want to talk more about it or need ideas, I'm here for you."
35,"Lately, I've been feeling really frustrated at work. I don't feel like my ideas and opinions are being heard or valued. It's starting to impact my confidence and job satisfaction.","I'm really sorry you're feeling this way. It can be tough when it seems like your contributions aren't being recognized or valued, especially when you care about your work. You're definitely not alone—many people go through periods like this, and it doesn't mean your ideas aren't worthwhile.

If you're comfortable, you might try having a one-on-one conversation with your manager or a trusted colleague to share how you're feeling. Sometimes, people aren't aware of how their actions (or inactions) are affecting others. You could also ask for feedback on your ideas or see if there are other ways to get involved in projects where your voice might be more easily heard.

Most importantly, try not to let this situation define your self-worth or confidence. Your ideas and opinions matter, and sometimes it just takes finding the right avenue or timing for them to be recognized. If you want to talk more about what's been happening or brainstorm ways to address it, I'm here to help."
36,My best friend and I have been arguing a lot lately. We can't seem to agree on our future plans and it's causing a lot of tension between us.,"I'm really sorry you're going through this—it sounds tough. It's normal for close friends to have disagreements, especially when it comes to important things like future plans. Sometimes, these kinds of conflicts can actually help you both understand each other better, even if it doesn't feel that way right now.

If you haven't already, it might help to have an honest conversation where you both share your feelings and listen to each other's perspectives without trying to ""win"" the argument. Sometimes, just feeling heard can make a big difference. You might also try to find some common ground or compromise, even if you can't agree on everything.

Remember, it's okay for friends to have different goals or paths in life. It doesn't have to mean the end of your friendship. Giving each other a little space to process things can also help. Whatever happens, try to be kind to yourself and your friend—these situations are hard, but they can also lead to growth for both of you. If you want to talk more about what's going on, I'm here to listen."
37,"We had an argument about something trivial, but it escalated into a big fight. Now we're not talking and it's making me feel really distant from them.","I'm really sorry you're feeling this way. It's tough when something small turns into a bigger conflict, especially when it leaves you feeling distant from someone you care about. Sometimes, arguments can get out of hand because of stress or underlying feelings, not just the issue itself.

If you feel ready, reaching out—even with a simple message—can help break the ice. You could acknowledge that things got heated and that you miss talking to them. It might feel vulnerable, but it can open the door to reconnecting and understanding each other better.

Remember, it's normal for relationships to have ups and downs. Taking the first step doesn't mean you're admitting fault; it just shows you value the relationship. If you want, I can help you think of what to say or how to approach the conversation."
38,"Lately, my coworker has been dismissing my ideas during team meetings and never takes my opinions seriously. It's really getting to me.","I'm really sorry you're dealing with that—it sounds frustrating and discouraging. It's tough when you feel like your contributions aren't being valued, especially in a team setting where everyone's input should matter.

If you feel comfortable, you might consider having a one-on-one conversation with your coworker. Sometimes people aren't aware of how their behavior is affecting others, and a calm, honest discussion can help. You could say something like, ""I've noticed that my ideas often get dismissed in meetings, and I wanted to talk about how we can better collaborate.""

If that doesn't feel right or doesn't help, you could also bring it up with your manager or team lead, focusing on how it impacts the team's effectiveness rather than making it personal.

In the meantime, try to keep sharing your ideas—your perspective is valuable, even if it doesn't always get the recognition it deserves right away. And remember, you're not alone; many people have faced similar challenges and found ways to work through them. If you want to talk more about strategies or need support, I'm here for you."
39,"I've been having so many arguments with my best friend lately. We were planning a trip together, but we can't seem to agree on the itinerary and it's causing a lot of tension between us.","I'm really sorry to hear that things have been tense between you and your friend. Planning a trip together can definitely bring up unexpected disagreements, especially when you both have different ideas of what makes a great vacation. It sounds like you both care about the trip and your friendship, which is a good starting point.

Maybe it would help to take a step back and talk openly about what each of you wants out of the trip. Sometimes just acknowledging that you have different priorities can make it easier to find a compromise. You could try making a list of the things that are most important to each of you and see if there’s a way to include a bit of both. Or, if possible, you could each plan a day or an activity, so you both get to experience what you enjoy.

Most importantly, try to remember why you wanted to travel together in the first place. Sometimes, focusing on the bigger picture—spending time together and making memories—can help put the smaller disagreements into perspective.

If you feel comfortable, you could also let your friend know how much their friendship means to you and that you don’t want the trip planning to get in the way of that. Sometimes just saying that out loud can help ease the tension.

Would you like to talk more about what you’re disagreeing on? Maybe I can help you brainstorm some solutions!"
40,"I've been better. I recently lost my dog, and it's been really tough. She was my best friend for 12 years, and I miss her deeply.","I'm so sorry to hear about your loss.

41,"Honestly, not great. I've been dealing with a lot of emotions ever since my long-term partner and I broke up. It's been really tough on me.","I'm really sorry you're going through such a hard time. Breakups, especially after a long relationship, can feel overwhelming and leave you with a lot of emotions to process. It's completely normal to feel sad, lost, or even angry right now. Be gentle with yourself and try to give yourself the space to feel whatever comes up.

If you want to talk more about what you're going through, I'm here to listen. Sometimes just sharing your thoughts or how your days have been can help a little. And if you need suggestions for coping or just a distraction, let me know—I'm here for you."
42,"Work has been really stressful lately. I'm feeling overwhelmed with the amount of work I have to do. The workload suddenly increased, and I'm struggling to meet deadlines and manage my time effectively.","I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. Sudden increases in workload can be overwhelming, and it's completely understandable to feel stressed when you're trying to keep up. Here are a few suggestions that might help:

1. **Prioritize Tasks:** Make a list of everything you need to do and identify what's most urgent or important. Focusing on high-priority tasks first can help you feel more in control.

2. **Break Tasks Down:** Large projects can feel less daunting if you break them into smaller, more manageable steps. Celebrate small wins as you complete each part.

3. **Set Boundaries:** If possible, communicate with your manager or team about your workload. They may not realize how much you have on your plate and could help you reprioritize or delegate tasks.

4. **Take Short Breaks:** Even a few minutes away from your desk can help clear your mind and reduce stress. Try to step outside, stretch, or do something you enjoy for a short time.

5. **Be Kind to Yourself:** Remember that it's okay not to be perfect. You're doing your best in a tough situation.

If you feel comfortable, consider reaching out to a supervisor or HR for support. You're not alone in feeling this way, and it's important to take care of your well-being. If you want to talk more about what's going on or need help brainstorming ways to manage your workload, I'm here to listen."
43,"It feels like whenever I try to express my feelings or concerns, my friend just doesn't understand or dismisses them. It's frustrating and makes me feel really isolated.","I'm really sorry you're feeling this way. It sounds incredibly tough to open up and not feel heard or understood, especially by someone you care about. Your feelings are valid, and it's understandable to feel isolated when your concerns aren't acknowledged.

Sometimes, people struggle to respond well to others' emotions—not because your feelings aren't important, but maybe because they don't know how to handle them or are dealing with their own stuff. Still, that doesn't make it any less frustrating for you.

If you feel comfortable, you might try letting your friend know how their reactions make you feel. You could say something like, ""When I share how I'm feeling and it gets dismissed, I end up feeling really alone."" Sometimes, being direct can help them realize the impact of their responses.

But remember, it's okay to seek support elsewhere too—whether that's from other friends, family, or even a counselor. You deserve to be heard and supported. If you want to talk more about it or need help figuring out what to say, I'm here for you."
44,"Hi, I'm okay. I've been having a tough time adjusting to my new job. I feel overwhelmed with the workload and constantly struggle to meet deadlines.","I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling overwhelmed. Starting a new job can be a big adjustment, and it's completely normal to feel this way, especially when you're still getting used to everything. If you feel comfortable, it might help to talk to your manager or a coworker about how you're feeling—they might be able to offer support, advice, or help you prioritize your tasks.

In the meantime, try to be kind to yourself and remember that it takes time to settle into a new role. Breaking your workload into smaller, manageable tasks and setting realistic goals for each day can sometimes make things feel less daunting.

It sounds like you're under a lot of stress, and that's completely understandable given your workload and the pressure you're experiencing. Chronic stress can have serious effects on both your mental and physical health, so it's important to take this seriously.

Here are a few suggestions that might help:

1. **Set Boundaries:** If possible, try to set clear boundaries around your work hours. Communicate with your boss about what is realistic and sustainable for you. Sometimes, managers aren't aware of the toll their demands are taking.

2. **Prioritize Tasks:** Focus on the most important tasks first and try not to get bogged down by less urgent work. If you have too much on your plate, see if you can delegate or ask for help.

3. **Take Breaks:** Even short breaks throughout the day can help you recharge. Step away from your workspace, stretch, or take a quick walk if you can.

4. **Practice Self-care:** Make time for activities that help you relax and recharge, whether that's exercise, meditation, reading, or spending time with loved ones.

5. **Talk to Someone:** If you're feeling overwhelmed, consider talking to a trusted friend, family member, or a mental health professional. Sometimes just sharing how you feel can make a big difference.

6. **Evaluate Your Situation:** If the demands of your job are consistently unsustainable, it might be worth considering whether this environment is right for you in the long term.

Trying to connect with new people can be exhausting, especially when it feels like no one quite ""clicks"" with you. You're definitely not alone in this—many people go through periods where it seems hard to find genuine connections.

Sometimes, it helps to focus on activities or groups centered around your interests, even if they're online at first. Whether it's a hobby, a book club, a class, or a volunteer opportunity, being in spaces where people share your passions can make it easier to find common ground. It can also take time—sometimes connections grow slowly, even if it doesn't feel like it at first.

If you want, you can share what your interests are, and maybe I can help brainstorm some ideas or places to look for like-minded people. And remember, it's okay to feel discouraged, but it doesn't mean things won't get better. You're doing something brave by putting yourself out there."

Job searching can be incredibly tough, especially when it feels like you're putting in so much effort and not seeing the results you want. Rejection is hard, but it doesn't reflect your worth or abilities—it often comes down to timing, fit, or things outside your control.

If you want, I can help you review your resume or cover letter, or even practice interview questions with you. Sometimes a fresh set of eyes or a little tweak can make a difference.
