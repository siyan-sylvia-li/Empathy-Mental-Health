Its been 3 days raining and I have had very little sleep because of my daughter bloods are very unsuitable at night time. Can't walk anymore that much, seems its pulling my belly muscles and it's really hurts (dr said its attached to the front wall) a quess that's why the pain and I feel already so big (emojis). I'm trying to eat lots of fruits. Not being healthy as I wish cos 5 days a week I'm to one who is cooking and looking after the house (husband does 12h shifts 5-6days a week). I'm just wrecked and if I feel so I have a cookie or chocolate or 2-4... hopefully wheater improves and so my energy levels and being a bit more healthier then atm. And no I didn't do the snacks. I cook every day 3 meals for fam of 5 and atm I do not have that energy to do extra at any level. Sorry.

Please continue to focus on balanced meals when possible and let me know if you need any specific guidance or adjustments to your plan. I look forward to your next update."
1,"The next two weeks are extremely busy in work with the last two teaching weeks of term. It should hopefully be less hectic once it gets to corrections. Life is very busy and stressful at the moment, so I am only focusing on making sure I get the supplements every day and trying not to eat too much chocolate for the next two weeks. I've been trying to add some fruit, but I'm still eating loads of veggies, so I'm not overly stressing about that one. I know exercise helps with all this, but I don't have the time or headspace to fit it in at the moment, especially not something new. I will look at the stretches and set a new goal once I have survived this fortnight!","Your plan to maintain your supplement routine and focus on balanced eating during this busy period is practical. Prioritizing core habits and postponing new exercise goals until your schedule eases is a reasonable approach. When you’re ready, incorporating stretches can be a manageable way to reintroduce physical activity."
2,"Hi (coach name), Thanks for your videos, only seeing the last 2 now. Yes all is fine with the goals. However you are right, logging them and engaging in app is not top priority at the moment. I am happy with the goals I've set, breakfast, water and walking is being achieved at my pace. I am motivated to do as much as I can regarding healthy choices but also listening to my body when I need rest and a cup of tea. Nausea and sickness has lessened in the last 2 weeks so that has enabled me to eat more consciously and get back to some healthy breakfasts (like yoghurt, fruit and seeds etc). Walking in the evening is still sporadic but I am enjoying it and have engaged in a 100k in 30 days for charity with work. Again I am doing this when I feel I can and at my own pace. I am happy with my diet and behaviour right now and cravings are not an issue actually. I find my blood sugar to be stable too. Unfortunately I cannot promise more engagement with App, I will log when I think of it. Hope thats okay (emojis) thanks again, (participant name)","Thank you for your update. It’s good to hear that you are progressing with your goals and making healthy choices at your own pace. Your approach to listening to your body and maintaining consistency is noted.

Less bread of course is still my coal l close list... or now might I need to munch less cookies. Its raining way too much for my liking and not having no energy lately will I say effect my treats snacking and mood lifting with food.

4,"Hi (coach name), I did a recording but I am not too sure where it saved so I stick with writing a little paragraph. Last week was a great week for exercise. I reached my 7 hrs a week exercise by doing my hour walk Monday to Friday and I started my exercise bike Friday and do that for 20 mins in the morning. Last Thursday I became really fizzy whilst on my walk and sweating. A weird sensation that came over me for about 10 mins. Perhaps my stomach was empty or was just over tired. My diet has not been great, although I've been drinking my water, food intake and treats have been a weakness, especially over the bank holiday weekend being out for picnics and a birthday party. The tips on physical activity is good. I actually do a good bit of gardening and cleaning so I should incorporate that into my exercise. I literally do not stop at home from 6.30 am intill 7pm. Kids are quite demanding (emoji)","Thank you for your update. You have maintained a strong exercise routine, meeting your weekly goal and adding cycling to your schedule.

5,"Hello (coach name) good morning. My week was great, tnks God (emojis) the only problem was that I got so angry with my husband during the week. Is it normal to get so angry during pregnancy? I hope you had a good week too. Thank you very much for the link, I gonna try to make something (emoji) and to contact the clinic. I have to take a vaccine on Wednesday and I can ask to my GP if he got my results. For any reason I ate much better during last week. I'll start to write down my all of my food, as you said. I think is going to be much better to understand what's happening.","Thank you for your update.

7,"Hi (coach name) Thank you! Yes baby boy born Wednesday, a lovely calm elective section and only 31 hours in hospital after. I am useless, sorry missed all of these messages and most from family and friends (emojis). Definitely did too much at once with a pretty non flexible deadline! Realised as well I never did a final weigh in before c section! Never managed to start up yoga or other exercise beyond daily life needs but as soon as I am fit and able I must start some activities again. Will book in for a video chat in January. Thank you for not giving up on me! Newborn life is just as I remember it but I seem to be more used to sleep deprivation so I will need to look at some of those mindfulness techniques you sent. Breastfeeding mega demanding and sore but I know will be best in the long run (just need to remember to put the vit d drops on before we start (emojis)). Whole house is very excited for Christmas, (name) is especially keen but I love it because it keeps me going.

8,"Hi (coach name), I’m doing ok thanks just really bad on keeping you updated on here. I’m really sorry. I was wondering going forwards if we could do quick 5-10 mins call update. Is this something you can do? I’m just very bad at assigning time to sit down and write as always get distracted and put it off to later. No worries if this is not possible. The PGP has actually calmed down which is great and have been able to go out for walks again and generally just move about a bit more. The midwife has referred me for some physio so waiting for an appointment to come through. I’m also told they might give me belt to wear which will help. I have noticed this week (probably because of the heat) that my fingers / hands & feet are quite swollen. My water intake has dropped so have put a reminder in my work calendar to alert me. Food wise, my portion size is still on the large size. Don’t know how to manage this. Hope to speak to you soon Thanks (participant name)","Thank you for your update. I can accommodate a 5-10 minute call for your check-ins going forward—please suggest some suitable times and I will confirm availability. It’s good to hear your PGP has improved and that you’re awaiting physio. For the swelling, maintaining adequate hydration is important, so your reminder is a good step.

Please confirm your preferred times for the call."
9,"Hi (coach name), Thanks for your advice about proteins, I’ve added it to my goals. Unfortunately, I’ve been extremely unwell the last 2 weeks which included me collapsing and having a lovely trip to hospital in an ambulance. My body is fighting a viral infection and shut down. I hit my head and have a lovely black eye. Due to this my goals and everything have taken a backseat. I’ve been advised to sit down as much as possible with my feet up. I’m struggling with controlling my body temp so am constantly hot which is making things worse! I went back to work Thursday and managed ok. The baby is causing me to have my first cravings - wholegrain cheerios! I’ve just booked in my c section in 5 weeks! Any advice on how to prepare would be great. I’ve been signposted to Bluebell to support with my mental health although feeling ok at the moment. I am starting maternity leave in 2 weeks so will have a lot more time for me (for a few weeks lol!) Sorry for the long message! (participant name)","Thank you for the update.
