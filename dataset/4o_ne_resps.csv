Its been 3 days raining and I have had very little sleep because of my daughter bloods are very unsuitable at night time. Can't walk anymore that much, seems its pulling my belly muscles and it's really hurts (dr said its attached to the front wall) a quess that's why the pain and I feel already so big (emojis). I'm trying to eat lots of fruits. Not being healthy as I wish cos 5 days a week I'm to one who is cooking and looking after the house (husband does 12h shifts 5-6days a week). I'm just wrecked and if I feel so I have a cookie or chocolate or 2-4... hopefully wheater improves and so my energy levels and being a bit more healthier then atm. And no I didn't do the snacks. I cook every day 3 meals for fam of 5 and atm I do not have that energy to do extra at any level. Sorry.

1,"The next two weeks are extremely busy in work with the last two teaching weeks of term. It should hopefully be less hectic once it gets to corrections. Life is very busy and stressful at the moment, so I am only focusing on making sure I get the supplements every day and trying not to eat too much chocolate for the next two weeks. I've been trying to add some fruit, but I'm still eating loads of veggies, so I'm not overly stressing about that one. I know exercise helps with all this, but I don't have the time or headspace to fit it in at the moment, especially not something new. I will look at the stretches and set a new goal once I have survived this fortnight!","It sounds like you have a clear plan for managing your workload and maintaining your health during this busy period. Prioritizing your supplements and a balanced diet is a practical approach. Once your schedule eases, revisiting your exercise routine and setting new goals will be beneficial. Stay focused on your current priorities, and consider scheduling time for stretches when feasible."
2,"Hi (coach name), Thanks for your videos, only seeing the last 2 now. Yes all is fine with the goals. However you are right, logging them and engaging in app is not top priority at the moment. I am happy with the goals I've set, breakfast, water and walking is being achieved at my pace. I am motivated to do as much as I can regarding healthy choices but also listening to my body when I need rest and a cup of tea. Nausea and sickness has lessened in the last 2 weeks so that has enabled me to eat more consciously and get back to some healthy breakfasts (like yoghurt, fruit and seeds etc). Walking in the evening is still sporadic but I am enjoying it and have engaged in a 100k in 30 days for charity with work. Again I am doing this when I feel I can and at my own pace. I am happy with my diet and behaviour right now and cravings are not an issue actually. I find my blood sugar to be stable too. Unfortunately I cannot promise more engagement with App, I will log when I think of it. Hope thats okay (emojis) thanks again, (participant name)","Thank you for the update. It's great to hear that you're making progress with your goals and listening to your body's needs. Your approach to maintaining a balanced diet and incorporating exercise at your own pace is commendable.

I feel extremely tired and struggling to get 10 thousand step per day and partly I feel worn out and a bit if pain cos womb is attached on the front of the belly wall and I have constant 'pulling/stretching' pain. Less bread of course is still my coal l close list... or now might I need to munch less cookies.

4,"Hi (coach name), I did a recording but I am not too sure where it saved so I stick with writing a little paragraph. Last week was a great week for exercise. I reached my 7 hrs a week exercise by doing my hour walk Monday to Friday and I started my exercise bike Friday and do that for 20 mins in the morning. Last Thursday I became really fizzy whilst on my walk and sweating. A weird sensation that came over me for about 10 mins. Perhaps my stomach was empty or was just over tired. My diet has not been great, although I've been drinking my water, food intake and treats have been a weakness, especially over the bank holiday weekend being out for picnics and a birthday party. The tips on physical activity is good. I actually do a good bit of gardening and cleaning so I should incorporate that into my exercise. I literally do not stop at home from 6.30 am intill 7pm. Kids are quite demanding (emoji)","It's great to hear that you met your exercise goals last week and have incorporated new activities like the exercise bike into your routine. The sensation you experienced during your walk could be due to several factors, such as low blood sugar or dehydration, so it's important to ensure you're adequately fueled and hydrated before exercising. While it's understandable that diet can be challenging, especially during social events, try to maintain a balanced approach to nutrition. Incorporating gardening and cleaning as part of your physical activity is a smart way to stay active. Keep up the good work and continue to find ways to balance exercise with your daily responsibilities."
5,"Hello (coach name) good morning. My week was great, tnks God (emojis) the only problem was that I got so angry with my husband during the week. Is it normal to get so angry during pregnancy?

I have to take a vaccine on Wednesday and I can ask to my GP if he got my results. For any reason I ate much better during last week. I'll start to write down my all of my food, as you said. I think is going to be much better to understand what's happening.","Good morning.

8,"Hi (coach name), I’m doing ok thanks just really bad on keeping you updated on here. I’m really sorry. I was wondering going forwards if we could do quick 5-10 mins call update. Is this something you can do? I’m just very bad at assigning time to sit down and write as always get distracted and put it off to later. No worries if this is not possible. The PGP has actually calmed down which is great and have been able to go out for walks again and generally just move about a bit more. The midwife has referred me for some physio so waiting for an appointment to come through. I’m also told they might give me belt to wear which will help. I have noticed this week (probably because of the heat) that my fingers / hands & feet are quite swollen. My water intake has dropped so have put a reminder in my work calendar to alert me. Food wise, my portion size is still on the large size. Don’t know how to manage this. Hope to speak to you soon Thanks (participant name)","Thank you for the update. A quick 5-10 minute call for updates can be arranged. Please let me know your availability, and we can schedule a time that works for both of us.

9,"Hi (coach name), Thanks for your advice about proteins, I’ve added it to my goals.

I hit my head and have a lovely black eye. Due to this my goals and everything have taken a backseat. I’ve been advised to sit down as much as possible with my feet up. I’m struggling with controlling my body temp so am constantly hot which is making things worse! I went back to work Thursday and managed ok. The baby is causing me to have my first cravings - wholegrain cheerios! I’ve just booked in my c section in 5 weeks! Any advice on how to prepare would be great. I’ve been signposted to Bluebell to support with my mental health although feeling ok at the moment. I am starting maternity leave in 2 weeks so will have a lot more time for me (for a few weeks lol!) Sorry for the long message! (participant name)","Thank you for the update.
