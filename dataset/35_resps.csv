Can't walk anymore that much, seems its pulling my belly muscles and it's really hurts (dr said its attached to the front wall) a quess that's why the pain and I feel already so big (emojis). I'm trying to eat lots of fruits. Not being healthy as I wish cos 5 days a week I'm to one who is cooking and looking after the house (husband does 12h shifts 5-6days a week). I'm just wrecked and if I feel so I have a cookie or chocolate or 2-4... hopefully wheater improves and so my energy levels and being a bit more healthier then atm. And no I didn't do the snacks. I cook every day 3 meals for fam of 5 and atm I do not have that energy to do extra at any level. Sorry. Thank you for your messages and talk to you soon (participant name)","Hello (participant name), thank you for sharing what you've been going through lately. It sounds like you have a lot on your plate, especially with your daughter's health concerns and the demands of taking care of your family while your husband works long hours. It's completely understandable that you're feeling exhausted and struggling to find the energy to take care of yourself.

Remember that it's important to prioritize your own well-being, even when things get overwhelming. It's great that you're trying to eat fruits and be mindful of your food choices, but it's also okay to give yourself some grace during this challenging time. It's okay to have a cookie or some chocolate when you need a little pick-me-up.

It's important to take care of yourself so that you can continue to take care of your family. Maybe you can try to find small moments for self-care, even if it's just a few minutes of deep breathing or a short walk outside to get some fresh air. And don't hesitate to ask for help or support from friends, family, or even your healthcare provider if you need it.

I'm here to support you, so please feel free to reach out whenever you need to talk. Take care of yourself, and remember that you're doing the best you can in a challenging situation."
1,"The next two weeks are extremely busy in work with the last two teaching weeks of term. It should hopefully be less hectic once it gets to corrections. Life is very busy and stressful at the moment, so I am only focusing on making sure I get the supplements every day and trying not to eat too much chocolate for the next two weeks. I've been trying to add some fruit, but I'm still eating loads of veggies, so I'm not overly stressing about that one. I know exercise helps with all this, but I don't have the time or headspace to fit it in at the moment, especially not something new. I will look at the stretches and set a new goal once I have survived this fortnight!","It sounds like you have a lot on your plate right now, but it's great that you are prioritizing your health by focusing on getting your supplements and trying to limit your chocolate intake. Remember, it's all about progress, not perfection, so don't be too hard on yourself if you indulge in a little extra chocolate during this busy time.

Incorporating fruits and veggies into your diet is fantastic, and it's great that you are still making an effort to eat well despite your hectic schedule. As for exercise, even just a short walk or some quick stretches can make a big difference in reducing stress and boosting your mood. It's okay if you can't commit to a full workout routine right now - every little bit helps.

Once things calm down after these next two weeks, you can reassess your goals and find a new exercise routine that works for you. In the meantime, be kind to yourself and remember that taking care of your mental and physical health is just as important as your work responsibilities. You've got this!"
2,"Hi (coach name), Thanks for your videos, only seeing the last 2 now. Yes all is fine with the goals. However you are right, logging them and engaging in app is not top priority at the moment. I am happy with the goals I've set, breakfast, water and walking is being achieved at my pace. I am motivated to do as much as I can regarding healthy choices but also listening to my body when I need rest and a cup of tea. Nausea and sickness has lessened in the last 2 weeks so that has enabled me to eat more consciously and get back to some healthy breakfasts (like yoghurt, fruit and seeds etc). Walking in the evening is still sporadic but I am enjoying it and have engaged in a 100k in 30 days for charity with work. Again I am doing this when I feel I can and at my own pace. I am happy with my diet and behaviour right now and cravings are not an issue actually. I find my blood sugar to be stable too. Unfortunately I cannot promise more engagement with App, I will log when I think of it. Hope thats okay (emojis) thanks again, (participant name)","Hi (participant name), 

I'm so glad to hear that you are doing well and that you are making progress towards your goals at your own pace. It's great that you are listening to your body and giving yourself the rest you need when necessary.

It's fantastic that you are participating in a charity event with work and that you are doing it in a way that feels right for you. Remember, it's all about progress, not perfection. It's important to find a balance that works for you and that you are happy with your current diet and behavior.

Logging in the app is just a tool to help you track your progress, but the most important thing is that you are feeling good and making positive choices for yourself. Keep up the great work, and remember to celebrate your successes along the way. If you ever need any support or have any questions, feel free to reach out. Take care and keep up the good work! ðŸ˜Š

It's great that you're still aiming to keep up with your step count and watching your bread intake.

4,"Hi (coach name), I did a recording but I am not too sure where it saved so I stick with writing a little paragraph. Last week was a great week for exercise. I reached my 7 hrs a week exercise by doing my hour walk Monday to Friday and I started my exercise bike Friday and do that for 20 mins in the morning. Last Thursday I became really fizzy whilst on my walk and sweating. A weird sensation that came over me for about 10 mins. Perhaps my stomach was empty or was just over tired. My diet has not been great, although I've been drinking my water, food intake and treats have been a weakness, especially over the bank holiday weekend being out for picnics and a birthday party. The tips on physical activity is good. I actually do a good bit of gardening and cleaning so I should incorporate that into my exercise. I literally do not stop at home from 6.30 am intill 7pm. Kids are quite demanding (emoji)","Hi there! It's great to hear about your commitment to exercise and reaching your goal of 7 hours per week. It sounds like you've been keeping active with your daily walks and incorporating the exercise bike into your routine. It's important to listen to your body, so if you experienced a strange sensation during your walk, it might be a good idea to ensure you're properly fueled and hydrated before exercising.

It's understandable that maintaining a healthy diet can be challenging, especially during social events like picnics and parties. Remember, it's all about balance, so enjoying treats in moderation is okay. It's fantastic that you're staying hydrated with water.

Incorporating activities like gardening and cleaning into your exercise routine is a great idea! It's all about finding ways to stay active that work for you and fit into your daily schedule. It sounds like you have a busy day with your kids, but it's wonderful that you're finding ways to keep moving throughout the day.

Keep up the great work, and remember to listen to your body and make time for self-care amidst your busy schedule. You're doing an amazing job balancing it all! Keep up the fantastic work! (emoji)"
5,"Hello (coach name) good morning. My week was great, tnks God (emojis) the only problem was that I got so angry with my husband during the week. Is it normal to get so angry during pregnancy? I hope you had a good week too. Thank you very much for the link, I gonna try to make something (emoji) and to contact the clinic. I have to take a vaccine on Wednesday and I can ask to my GP if he got my results. For any reason I ate much better during last week. I'll start to write down my all of my food, as you said. I think is going to be much better to understand what's happening.","Hello! I'm glad to hear that overall your week was great. It's not uncommon for emotions to run high during pregnancy, as hormonal changes can contribute to mood swings and increased irritability. It's important to communicate openly with your husband about how you're feeling and to find healthy ways to manage your anger, such as taking deep breaths, going for a walk, or practicing relaxation techniques.

It's great that you're planning to track your food intake. Keeping a food diary can help you identify patterns in your eating habits and make any necessary adjustments for a healthier diet during pregnancy. Remember to focus on nutrient-dense foods that will support both your health and the baby's development.

Good luck with your vaccine appointment on Wednesday, and don't hesitate to reach out to your GP with any questions or concerns. Keep up the good work with your self-care efforts, and feel free to update me on your progress. Have a wonderful week ahead!"

7,"Hi (coach name) Thank you! Yes baby boy born Wednesday, a lovely calm elective section and only 31 hours in hospital after. I am useless, sorry missed all of these messages and most from family and friends (emojis). Definitely did too much at once with a pretty non flexible deadline! Realised as well I never did a final weigh in before c section! Never managed to start up yoga or other exercise beyond daily life needs but as soon as I am fit and able I must start some activities again. Will book in for a video chat in January. Thank you for not giving up on me! Newborn life is just as I remember it but I seem to be more used to sleep deprivation so I will need to look at some of those mindfulness techniques you sent. Breastfeeding mega demanding and sore but I know will be best in the long run (just need to remember to put the vit d drops on before we start (emojis)). Whole house is very excited for Christmas, (name) is especially keen but I love it because it keeps me going. Hope you're well and looking forward to Christmas with the family (participant name) x","Congratulations on the birth of your baby boy! It's wonderful to hear that the elective section went smoothly and that you're adjusting to life with a newborn. It's completely understandable that you've been busy and haven't had time for much else. Remember to take it easy and prioritize self-care during this time.

Breastfeeding can be challenging, but it's great that you're committed to it for the long run. Don't forget those vitamin D drops! And it's fantastic that you're considering incorporating mindfulness techniques to help with sleep deprivation.

I'm glad to hear that the whole house is excited for Christmas. It's a special time of year, especially with a new addition to the family. Take care of yourself and enjoy this festive season. Looking forward to our video chat in January. Congratulations again!"
8,"Hi (coach name), Iâ€™m doing ok thanks just really bad on keeping you updated on here. Iâ€™m really sorry. I was wondering going forwards if we could do quick 5-10 mins call update. Is this something you can do? Iâ€™m just very bad at assigning time to sit down and write as always get distracted and put it off to later. No worries if this is not possible. The PGP has actually calmed down which is great and have been able to go out for walks again and generally just move about a bit more. The midwife has referred me for some physio so waiting for an appointment to come through. Iâ€™m also told they might give me belt to wear which will help. I have noticed this week (probably because of the heat) that my fingers / hands & feet are quite swollen. My water intake has dropped so have put a reminder in my work calendar to alert me. Food wise, my portion size is still on the large size. Donâ€™t know how to manage this. Hope to speak to you soon Thanks (participant name)","Hi (participant name), 

I'm glad to hear that the PGP has calmed down and that you've been able to go out for walks again. It's great that the midwife has referred you for physio and that they might provide you with a belt to help. It's important to address any physical discomfort during pregnancy, so it's good that you're taking steps to manage it.

Regarding your request for a quick 5-10 minute call update going forward, I completely understand your struggle with finding time to sit down and write. I appreciate your honesty about this challenge. I will do my best to accommodate a brief call for updates. Let's find a time that works for both of us to touch base regularly.

It's also good that you've noticed the swelling in your fingers, hands, and feet. Remember to stay hydrated, especially in the heat, and it's great that you've set a reminder in your work calendar to help with your water intake. As for managing your portion sizes, it can be helpful to listen to your body's hunger and fullness cues. Eating slowly and mindfully can also help you recognize when you're satisfied.

I look forward to speaking with you soon and continuing to support you on your pregnancy journey. Take care!

9,"Hi (coach name), Thanks for your advice about proteins, Iâ€™ve added it to my goals. Unfortunately, Iâ€™ve been extremely unwell the last 2 weeks which included me collapsing and having a lovely trip to hospital in an ambulance. My body is fighting a viral infection and shut down. I hit my head and have a lovely black eye. Due to this my goals and everything have taken a backseat. Iâ€™ve been advised to sit down as much as possible with my feet up. Iâ€™m struggling with controlling my body temp so am constantly hot which is making things worse! I went back to work Thursday and managed ok. The baby is causing me to have my first cravings - wholegrain cheerios! Iâ€™ve just booked in my c section in 5 weeks! Any advice on how to prepare would be great. Iâ€™ve been signposted to Bluebell to support with my mental health although feeling ok at the moment. I am starting maternity leave in 2 weeks so will have a lot more time for me (for a few weeks lol!) Sorry for the long message! (participant name)","Hello (participant name),

I'm sorry to hear that you've been unwell and had to go through such a scary experience. It's important to prioritize your health and well-being during this time, so please make sure to follow your doctor's advice and take it easy as much as possible.

Congratulations on booking your c-section! As you prepare for the arrival of your baby, it's a good idea to start getting organized and setting up your home for the new addition. Make sure you have all the essentials ready, such as baby clothes, diapers, and a safe sleeping space.

Since you mentioned having your first cravings, it's important to listen to your body and indulge in those cravings in moderation. Wholegrain cheerios can be a tasty and nutritious snack, so enjoy them guilt-free!

Starting maternity leave in 2 weeks will give you some much-needed time to rest and prepare for the arrival of your baby. Take this time to focus on self-care and relaxation, as well as getting any last-minute tasks done before the baby arrives.

It's great that you've been signposted to Bluebell for mental health support. Remember that it's okay to reach out for help if you need it, and taking care of your mental health is just as important as your physical health during this time.

Take care of yourself and best of luck with the rest of your pregnancy journey. If you have any more questions or need further advice, feel free to reach out.

Take care,
